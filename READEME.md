# 📂 Document Uploader Project

## 🎬 Project Overview


This project is a Spring Boot web application that enables users to upload and manage documents. The system processes file uploads and securely stores them in a structured manner. It integrates Thymeleaf for frontend rendering and manages static resources effectively.

## 🚀 Key Features:
1. Upload and store documents
2. View and download uploaded files
3. Simple UI using Thymeleaf
4. Backend powered by Spring Boot
5. File storage in a structured directory
6. Static resource management (CSS, JavaScript)
7. Error handling and validation for file uploads

🏗️ Technology Design
1. Frontend: Thymeleaf (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. Backend: Spring Boot (Java), Spring MVC
3. Storage: Local file system (can be extended to AWS S3 or another cloud storage)
4. Build Tool: Maven
5. Security: Basic authentication using Spring Security

## 🛡️ Security Considerations:

1. Validation for allowed file types and sizes
2. Prevention of directory traversal attacks
3. Error handling for invalid file operations

## 📦 Dependencies & Tools Used:

1. Spring Boot (Backend framework)
2. Thymeleaf (Templating engine for HTML rendering)
3. Maven (Dependency management and build tool)
4. Java 17+ (Programming language)

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup:

### Prerequisites:
1. Java 17+
2. Maven

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 🔐 Security Implementations:

## 🔐 Security Implementations:

1. File validation to restrict potentially harmful uploads
2. Error handling to prevent exposure of sensitive data
3. Secure storage architecture

## 📊 Performance Optimization:

1. Caching strategies for file access
2. Optimized file upload handling with efficient I/O

## 🚀 Deployment Guide:

1. Configure external storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or any other persistent storage solution).
2. Set environment variables for security configurations.
3. Deploy using a containerized approach with Docker (optional).

## 📈 Scaling Strategy:

1. Horizontal scaling using containerized services
2. Integrating cloud-based storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.)

## 💡 Future Improvements:

1. Integration with cloud storage for scalability
2. Authentication and role-based access control
3. Support for multiple file formats and preview functionality
